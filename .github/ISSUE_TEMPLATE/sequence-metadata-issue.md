### Describe the possible issue
A clear and concise description of what seems to be be wrong with the sequences/metadata.

### Evidence of the problem
Please post pictures or links to phylogenies, results of analyses, links to articles or manuscripts, or other supporting evidence that shows that the current data is incorrect.

### Suggested change
Please describe what the corrected data should be, or what should be done to fix the current data. Being as detailed as possible is helpful. If possible and appropriate, you can attach a table or list to the bottom of this issue listing the accession number and corrected value.

If the issue is severe and misleading, and no correction is possible, you can propose that the sequences be revoked. (However, you should show clearly why this is necessary.)

### Full list of affected sequences
Please list _all_ impacted Pathoplexus accession numbers that may be incorrect due to the reason above. If some sequences may be incorrect for a _different_ reason, please create a new, separate issue for these.

Please be sure to list _all_ sequences, so that all can be corrected if necessary.
